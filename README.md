Any input between MIDI notes 60 - 66 will output an unweighted monophonic network-walk-melody from Complex 1 (c, ef, ef↑, e, f, gf, g)

Any input between MIDI notes 67 - 71 will output an unweighted monophonic network-walk-melody from Complex 2 (g, a, bf, b, c)

Any input between MIDI notes 72 - 76 will output an unweighted monophonic network-walk-melody from Complex 3 (c, d, ef, ef↑, e)

I'm editorializing a little bit based on a blog post from Ethan Hein in the following paragraph: https://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2014/blues-tonality/

> Jeff Titon (1977) believes that blue notes should be included in the basic definition of the blues scale. Using a corpus of recordings of “downhome” or country blues made between 1926 and 1930, Titon identifies the set of the most commonly occurring pitches as the “downhome blues scale” (p. 155).

> The downhome blues scale in C consists of the following pitches: 
* C; D; E complex (E-flat, E, and two distinct intermediate pitches); 
* F; G complex (F-sharp, G, and one distinct intermediate pitch); 
* A; B complex (B-flat, B, and one distinct intermediate pitch); 
* C’; D’; and E’ complex.
 
> Titon maintains that the scale should span a tenth rather than an octave, because *the blues musicians in his study treat the lower octave differently than the higher one.* 

> Court Cutting’s (2018) digital analysis of vocal pitches from fifteen classic early blues recordings aligns with Titon’s findings, identifying three main blue note clusters (complexes?): the neutral third, a collection of pitches between 4^ and ♯4^, and a collection of pitches surrounding around ♭ 7^.
